# Project 2

Name: Iamnotblind

Overview: A way for people to connect online and share, based on random selection, how their actions and words affect themselves.

Step one: System chooses by random a main postee, of which who will write words that will, to their surprise affect them and everyone else around them.

Step two: Commenters will be selected at random to write what they thought the meaning of the words the postee had said, and to their surprise they will affect everyone around them and themselves.

Step three: Comments will only show after 1 day.

Step four: Comments will be disabled.

Step five: After 1 day the system will ask for the postee to reveal how they felt about their own post and what everyone else had to say about it. Comments will be disabled.

Step six: After 1 day the system will ask the commenters to reveal how they felt about their own comment and about the postee's post. Comments will be disabled.

Step seven: After 2 days the system will ask the postee about how they felt about the outcome of what they said and how everyone else took it. Comments will be disabled.

Step eight: After 2 days the system will ask the commenters about how they felt about the outcome of what they said and how the postee took it. Comments will be disabled.

Step nine: Data analysis will reveal that between the 2 parties, everything is a 2 way road. Sometimes everyone just wants to walk on one side of it while one person is alone on the other side. Comments will be disabled.

Step ten: Data analysis will reveal that perspective is only to the eye of the beholder, and the eye of the beholder can be blind. They may only see themsevles in the road. Comments will be disabled.
